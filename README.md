## HTML Blocks elements vs Inline elements

**The HTML elements can be categorized into two broader categories, inline and block elements.**<br>
**The block elements break the flow of content and start a new line - here are som examples of block element**<br>
**Two commonly used block elements are: `<h1>` and `<p>`.**<br><br>

### Example

`<h1>`Hello World`</h1>`<br>
`<p>`This is a paragraph.`<p>`<br>

**Here are the block-elements in HTML:**<br>
`<address>` `<article>` `<aside>` `<blockquote>` `<canvas>` `<dd>` `<div>` `<dl>` `<dt>` `<fieldset>` `<figcaption>` `<figure>` `<footer>` `<form>` `<h1>`-`<h6>` `<header>` `<hr>` `<li>` `<main>`
`<nav>` `<ol>` `<pre>` `<section>` `<table>` `<tfoot>` `<ul>` `<video>`<br><br>

**An inline element does not start on a new line - it only takes up as much width as necessary.**<br>
**The `<span>` element is a inline tag**<br>

### Example

`<span>`Hello World`</span>`<br>

**Here are other inline-elements in HTML:**<br>

`<a>` `<abbr>` `<acronym>` `<b>` `<bdo>` `<big>` `<br>` `<button>` `<cite>` `<code>` `<em>` `<i>` `<img>` `<input>` `<label>` `<map>`
`<object>` `<output>` `<q>` `<samp>` `<script>` `<select>` `<small>` `<span>` `<strong>` `<sub>` `<sup>` `<textarea>` `<time>` <br>
